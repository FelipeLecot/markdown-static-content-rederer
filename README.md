# Features of the Application
This application is a full-stack JavaScript application that returns pages based on URLs that match the paths of the folders and sub-folders in the `src/content` folder. The content of these pages comes from a combination of the template HTML file and a markdown `index.md` file contained in the directory requested. E.g. if the requested path is `/home/about` there must be a `src/content/home/about/index.md` file to be rendered.

Features:
- React on the front-end.
- Express server for handling HTTP requests.
- Markdown files to store content.
- HTML template files to contain the markdown content.
- XML sitemap generator based on the valid paths in the `content` folder.
- Tests to verify that requests to valid URLs return a 200 HTTP status code, that requests to valid URLs return a body that contains the HTML generated from the relevant `index.md` markdown file, and that requests to URLs that do not match content folders return a 404 HTTP status code.
